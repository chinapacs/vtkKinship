               This property defines the rate of subsampling used to approximate
               the convolution kernel elements.
               - If the AutoSubSampling property is true, the source find the
               closest value to SubSampling in order to ensure an integer
               subdivision of each voxel depending on kernel size (e.g if KernelSize
               is 23 and SubSampling is 100, the 'real' subsampling will be
               (int)(100/23)*23 = 92. Then each voxel will be divided in 92/23 = 4
               sub-voxels.
               - If the AutoSubSampling property is false, each voxel is divided in
               'SubSampling' sub-voxels.

               If 1, the voxel subsampling depends on the kernel size. If 0, each
               voxel is divided in 'SubSampling' subvoxels.
