  abstract = {Visualization of tubular structures such as blood vessels is an important
	topic in medical imaging. One way to display tubular structures for
	diagnostic purposes is to generate longitudinal cross-sections in
	order to show their lumen, wall, and surrounding tissue in a curved
	plane. This process is called curved planar reformation (CPR). We
	present three different methods to generate CPR images. A tube-phantom
	was scanned with computed tomography (CT) to illustrate the properties
	of the different CPR methods. Furthermore we introduce enhancements
	to these methods: thick-CPR, rotating-CPR and multi-path-CPR.},
