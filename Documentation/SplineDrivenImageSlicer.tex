\begin{abstract}
\noindent
In this article, a spline driven image slicer algorithm is presented. It is
concretized through a vtkAlgorithm-inherited class that takes two inputs and
gives two outputs. The first input is the volume from which the slice should
reconstructed while the second one is the spline which tangent vector is used as
slicing plane normal. The first output is a 2D image resliced from the volume.
The second input gives the geometric information of the slice plane location in
the volume space. An example of use is given through a simulation of a dental
panoramic view from a MDCT volume. A straightened curved planar reformation is
also applied on vascular images.

Slicing through volume data is a common task in scientific visualization. Lots
of existing image processing tools provide this necessary functionality as soon
as the visualization of 3D (or more) data has to be performed on a 2D screen.

In VTK, different ways are possible, depending on the particular slicing needed
by the end-user. The simplest is vtkExtractVOI if the desired slice is parallel
to the input image axes. This method is used in ParaView in the Slice 
Representation. The most sophisticated is the vtkImageReslice filter in which
the cutting plane may be oriented arbitraly in the volume space. 

The algorithm presented here aims at computing the slicing orientation of a
vtkImageReslice filter directly from an input spline curve. This orientation
is defined as the Frenet-Serret frame at each point of the spline. In the 
following, a Frenet-Serret variant is proposed in order for the spline tangents
to be used as slice plane normals. An application on mandibule panoramic 
visualisation is presented, as well as an implementation of the Straightened
Curved Planar Reformation in vascular imaging.

\section{Frenet-Serret frame along a curve}
Frenet \cite{FRE52} and Serret \cite{SER51} defined independently several
properties on non degenerate curves from the euclidean space. Though the 
Frenet--Serret formulas aim to describe moving particles, they may be of
interest for defining local charts in a 3D space. 
%
\subsection{Initial definition}
%
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a continuous differentiable curve in the euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^3$ parameterized by $t$. Each point of $\mathcal{C}$ has $(x,y,z)$
coordinates. The Frenet--Serret frame of $\mathcal{C}$ at $t$ is made of the 
tangent $T$, normal $N$ and binormal $B$ unit vectors with:
\begin{eqnarray}
T(t) &=& \frac{d\mathcal{C}(t)}{dt}\label{eq:tangent}\\
N(t) &=& \frac{dT(t)}{dt}\label{eq:normal}\\
B(t) &=& T(t)\times N(t)\label{eq:binormal}
\end{eqnarray}
%
Figure~\ref{fig:frenet-serret_frames} shows such frames along a closed curve
in $3D$-space. It is important to note that equations~\eqref{eq:tangent}--\eqref{eq:binormal}
define a set of charts without taking into account the curvature and torsion of
the curve.

Normals $N$ are red and Binormals $B$ are yellow.}

%
\subsection{Coherent consecutive normals computation}
%
The normals of a curve have the property to be directed according to the 
center of curvature. A corollary is that at each change of the sign of 
curvature, the normal will flip. Figure~\ref{fig:sin_normals:fs} illustrates
this behaviour.

a change of orientation of the normal. The point where curvature is $0$ has 
null normal. (b) Arbitrary enforcing normals orientation brings consistency
along the curve.}
