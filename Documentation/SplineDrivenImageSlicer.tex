\begin{abstract}
\noindent
In this article, a spline driven image slicer algorithm is presented. It is
concretize through a vtkAlgorithm inherited class that takes two inputs and
gives two outputs. The first input is the
volume from which the slice should reconstructed while the second one is the spline which tangent
vector is used as slicing plane normal. The first output is a 2D image resliced from the volume. The second input gives the geometric information of the reslice plane location in the volume space.
An example of use is given through a simulation of a dental panoramic view from a MDCT volume. a straightened curved planar reformation is also possible and discussed.
